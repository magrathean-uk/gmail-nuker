# gmail-nuker working guidance

- Preserve the distinction between source publication and authorised mailbox operation. Do not authenticate, send, unsubscribe, purge, or alter live filters without explicit task authority.
- Never read or publish real credential values or mailbox contents for routine source work. Use synthetic fixtures and mocked services. Keep local credential files ignored and outside commits.
- Read SECURITY.md and docs/limitations.md before changing account, target, deletion, network, or sending behavior. Commit controls, scope expansion, sender-controlled URLs, and partial failure handling are security-sensitive.
- Keep CLI, GUI, privacy, setup, operations, and limitations docs consistent with the implementation. Do not claim permanent deletion, complete cleanup, verified attribution, or provider endorsement without evidence.
- Run relevant checks from docs/development.md. Source builds do not prove live mailbox behavior. Record actual verification and remaining gaps.
- Keep changes focused; avoid unrelated refactors and fabricated release claims. Maintain third-party provenance in NOTICE.

## Clean development (mandatory)

This project follows [Clean Development](https://github.com/magrathean-uk/clean-development) and the machine rule that nothing creates tool state under `~` (only the allow-listed agent homes).

- Load `~/dev/machine/env.zsh`; `~/.zshenv` does this for every zsh. Machine storage preferences live in `~/dev/machine/storage.conf`; workspace navigation is in `~/dev/START-HERE.md`.
- New sessions select `/Volumes/4TB/machine/cache` when the configured volume is actually mounted and writable, otherwise `~/dev/machine/cache` for ordinary smaller work. Use routed `DEVCACHE`, `CLEAN_DEVELOPMENT_{ROOT,CACHE_ROOT,BUILD_ROOT,SCRATCH_ROOT}`, `BOLYKI_DEV_LIBS` and `TMPDIR`; builds and scratch are beneath the selected cache. Keep active-session destinations fixed; stop if required storage disappears. Other users configure their own volume and fallback.
- SpecieX, large video/model jobs and VMs require external storage; never use internal fallback. Persistent labs, credentials, installed toolchains, source and final deliverables are not disposable caches.
- All active Git entry points belong under `~/dev/source/`, third-party repositories in `source/third-party/`, websites in `source/magrathean/`, and Teslatlas products/docs in `source/teslatlas-service/`. Do not read, scan, move or edit `~/dev/porn`.
- Preserve routed tool homes/caches, caller overrides and SDK/toolchain choices. Never unset or bypass routing. Scrubbed environments must restore the reviewed routing before cache-writing tools run; preserve intentional hermetic Git/Cargo isolation.
- Run builds, tests, installs and anything else that writes caches or build output through Clean Development: `clean-development run --session session-only -- <command>`. Follow its docs and keep its receipts.
- Do not add installers or scripts that default into `~` (`~/.cargo`, `~/.rustup`, `~/.cache`, `~/.npm`, `~/.swiftpm`, `~/.gradle`, ...) and do not hardcode `$HOME` paths for caches; use the routed variables.
- Before finishing, run `dev-env-check`, `dev-projects-check` and `dev-audit`; require passing environment/project checks and no new home-audit entries compared with the task baseline. Fix violations your work caused.
